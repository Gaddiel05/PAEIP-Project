# PAEIP-Project

## 📊 Pan-African Economic Intelligence Platform (PAEIP)

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides an interactive economic dashboard for East African countries, built using:
- Flask (backend)
- SQLite (database)
- Chart.js (interactive charts)
- HTML/CSS/JS (front-end)
- CSV export functionality
- User authentication (signup/signin)

It loads macroeconomic data from the JSON file: East-African-data.json, and stores it into an SQLite database (paei.db).
